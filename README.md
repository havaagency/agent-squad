from agent_squad import Agent

# Create a new agent
my_agent = Agent(name="ChatBot")

# Define a simple response function
def respond(input_text):
    return f"You said: {input_text}"

# Set the agent's response function
my_agent.set_response_function(respond)

# Start the agent
my_agent.start()
```
